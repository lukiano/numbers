Scala Numbers DSL:

Are you tired of writing those positive numbers with 0-9 symbols? Do you even remember the last time you wrote 2 as "two"? If you yearn those times, this library comes to the rescue.

Wanna try it?

- download the project and run "sbt console" to start a Scala REPL.
- import com.lleggieri.N._
- have fun!
